Module 4 Assignment As a first task, we need to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. I was given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The main task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
The entire logic was written using Jupyter notebook web application.  

The files included are as below

main.ipynb (This file includes the input and output of the task given)
schools_complete.csv
students_complete.csv

Analysis done on the output:
---------------------------
Various reports have been generated taking into consideration the number of students per school, their total average and total percentage of scores #in Maths and Reading subjects. THe scope of analysis is restricted to local government area only. The reports gives the comparative analysis of schools #in terms of thier performance in Maths and Reading (with Average and Total pass percentages). Some reports gives the top 5 and bottom 5 numbers based 
on their pass percentage performance. Some reports gives a view of % percentage of Maths and Reading across 4 year grades. (Grade 9 to Grade 12). Some # reports even present the performance of students from each school including the spend on each student by respective schools. Overall the reports give # a correct view of each school in the local government area and will enable the residents in the local government area to take decisions for enrolling # their children in these schools. 

Conclusions below
 1. The pass by school size trend indicates that smaller the size of the school students, better the pass percentage across Maths and Reading
 2. The overall pass percentage seems to be higher for Independant schools than the government schools
